\Abstract

This work describes the development of the web platform {\bf MeuPetAqui}, a social network for pet owners and animal protection non-governmental organizations (\gls{NGOs}). The platform allows users to create posts, connect with others, promote adoption, search for owners of found animals, and assist in tracking lost animals. It also includes features such as the General Animal Registry (\gls{RGA}) for pet and owner identification, as well as vaccination control to facilitate management of vaccines and medications received by the animal. The platform also serves as a means of promoting fundraising campaigns for the treatment of animals cared for by NGOs.

The platform is used by two types of users: regular users, who can create posts, profiles for their pets, and issue alerts related to adoption, found or lost pets; and NGOs, who have the same functionalities, as well as alerts for animals in need of veterinary care. User posts and their friends' posts are displayed in the main timeline, while a second timeline is dedicated exclusively to alerts, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness and engaging in animal welfare causes.

This work addresses the creation of a system that promotes awareness and engagement in animal welfare issues. The MeuPetAqui platform is a valuable tool for connecting sympathizers of the cause, pet owners, and NGOs, actively contributing to reducing the number of abandoned animals and fostering healthy relationships between owners and their pets.
