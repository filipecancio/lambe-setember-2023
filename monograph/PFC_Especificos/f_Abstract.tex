\Abstract

Here is the abstract text of your work.
The {\bf Abstract} must give an idea of the project as a whole, so that whoever reads the abstract knows how to recognize what will be detailed in the body of the work, so {\bf the abstract must be complete, describe the project, cite objectives, show results found, and conclusions}, all in a single page.
    
The abstract should be a thumbnail of your completed project. The Abstract must provide enough data to the reader so that he understands the entire project carried out, showing objectives, results {\bf (focus a lot on the results found)} and conclusions so that the reader is willing to read the rest of the work, to check the details of what you have just read in the abstract.

The abstract is where you should "Sell Your Work", it is your "Advertisement" that will convince the reader that your project is interesting and should be read and appreciated in greater detail when reading the next pages.
    
The {\bf Title} of the job is considered to be the most important part of your job advertisement, and in second place is the Abstract.
